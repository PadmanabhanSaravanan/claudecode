Scaffloding Project

```
1. Backend: 
    - Built with Node.js and ExpressJS 
    - Use inmemory storage (e.g., an array or list) instead of db 
    - Define a simple "User" model with fileds: described in openapi Specification
    - Expose Rest API endpoints asper the OpenAPI Specification 

2. Fronend: 
    -Build with React and React Router
    - create a simple UI to interact with the backend API
    - use Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend
    - use basic Bootstrap for styling the application 

3. Project Structure:
    - Organize the project into separate folders for backend in "server/" and frontend in "client/" directories
    - Use a monorepo structure to manage both parts of the application in a single repository 
    - include 'package.json' files in both 'server/' and 'client/' directories to manage dependencies separately

4. Add commnets to expalin each section of the code for better understanding
